# Mongo Todo List

This is Part 2 of a series of labs working towards building your first full stack web app. 

- [Part 1 - TDD todo list](https://github.com/wdi-sg/tdd-todo-list)
- (this repo)
- [Part 3 - Express todo list pt1](https://github.com/wdi-sg/express-todo-list-pt1)
- (optional) [Part 3.1 - Mocha, Chai and Supertest todo list](https://github.com/wdi-sg/mocha-todo-list)
- [Part 4 - Express todo list pt2](https://github.com/wdi-sg/express-todo-list-pt2)

We've learnt how to create CRUD actions and how to save them to a file. In this Lab, we'll instead save them to a Mongo Database database using [Mongoose](https://jeremiahalex.gitbooks.io/wdi-sg/content/05-express/express-mongoose/readme.html).

You can use the build in REPL to test your functionality.

## Getting Started

* Fork and clone this repository
* Run `npm install` to install dependencies
* `npm start` - run the REPL

##Requirements

Add a Mongoose schema and model to your `models/todo.js` file. Then fill in the CRUD actions in your `controllers/todo_controller.js` to interact with your Mongoose Todo Model.

__Warning__: Mongoose is Asynchronous, so we'll need to use callbacks to wait for data to save.

## Bonus

Use Mongoose Validations to ensure that only valid TODOs are saved.
